We are the University of Southampton Sailing Robot Team. We build a boat that sails on its own.

To put things in a little more detail, we are a student group that works on our own autonomous sailboat. Don't know what autonomous sailboats are about? [Here's](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20171115-can-an-autonomous-sailboat-cross-the-atlantic) [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN4D5wxfBpA) [bunch](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/saildrone/) [of](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896316320791) [links](https://www.cruisingworld.com/autonomous-sailing) [for](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/602414/fleets-of-robotic-boats-are-getting-ready-to-set-sail/) [you](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~yc6n13/mrobot.html) (last one's by one of our team members :)). We take our hand-crafted (with the help of parts sponsors) sailboat to the annual [World Robotic Sailing Championship](https://www.roboticsailing.org/). We're so good at what we do, we've won overall champions in our [first](https://connects.soton.ac.uk/2016/10/25/southampton-robot-team-sails-to-success/) [two](http://blog.sotonsailrobot.org/articles/wrsc2017-victory/) tries!

If you're interested in keeping up to speed with what we do, well, you're already at a pretty good starting place with this blog! We've a [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/maritimeroboticssouthampton) page too, if you fancy a follow. And for the more code-inclined, we have all our code [right here](https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/sailing-robot).

We hope you have a good day!

<!-- We are a group of University of Southampton students designing and building the ultimate autonomous sailing robot. We won the World Robot Sailing Championship (WRSC) 2016 in Viana do Castelo, Portugal with our boat Black Python. We are now preparing to defend our title in the 2017 championship.

WRSC is an autonomous sailboat competition that aims at stimulating the development of autonomous marine robotics, through short distance races, navigation and autonomy challenges. The accompanying IRSC (International Robotic Sailing Conference) provides researchers working on problems related to autonomous sailing the chance to exchange ideas during a scientific conference. -->
