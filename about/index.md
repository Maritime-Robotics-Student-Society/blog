We are a group of University of Southampton students designing and building the ultimate autonomous sailing robot. We won the World Robot Sailing Championship (WRSC) 2016 in Viana do Castelo, Portugal with our boat Black Python. We are now preparing to defend our title in the 2017 championship.

WRSC is an autonomous sailboat competition that aims at stimulating the development of autonomous marine robotics, through short distance races, navigation and autonomy challenges. The accompanying IRSC (International Robotic Sailing Conference) provides researchers working on problems related to autonomous sailing the chance to exchange ideas during a scientific conference.
