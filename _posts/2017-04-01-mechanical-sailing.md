If you have been following our blog posts over the last years, you will know: 
Software is full of errors and waterproofing electronics is a pain!
We are excited to announce that this year we will take a completely novel approach to the
world robotic sailing championship this year, which will solve all our problems. 
We are going fully mechanical with our newest mechanical robot DaVinci, gearing up to 
be victorious!

How will this work you ask?
Over the last two months we have designed gearboxes that will implement the rudder and sail motions for
all manoeuvres we need: Tacking, jibing, and keeping a heading.
Before any competition event, we will pre-program the heading and distance the vehicle has to
go between each waypoint. We have made a simulation of the gearboxes, which allows us to test our settings
beforehand.
To make our sailing robot more accurate than ever, we incorporate the rotation of an anemometer 
at the top of our boat and the rotation of a current measuring wheel below our boat. A faster spinning 
anemometer decreases the time between manoeuvres, allowing the DaVinci to consider the speed of the wind
and thus its own speed. The spinning speed and direction of the current measuring wheel 
corrects the heading settings.
Finally, to increase stability and improve the tacking capability of our boat, we added two spinning wheels.
One to keep the boat 

Now the mechanical implementation starts: This week we are starting to 3D print the gear parts that have
lower torque on them.

our manufacturing progress and details on our simulation.

So, Veni, Vidi, Vinci!
