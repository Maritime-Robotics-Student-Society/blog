As a team we decided to make all our work available on [Github](https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/sailing-robot). This actually means that all other teams can see our code. A regular question we get is: What if other teams copy your work? - We are not worried about that! Public work is what makes our work possible in the first place. It makes our progress faster, since we can all easily and freely get the latest version of our software and documentation.

And if people do copy our work we are still the people who best understand it. If they go ahead and improve it, then all of us win. Overall, there will be a better sailing robot out there, having our code as the root!

This is the work we are building on:
