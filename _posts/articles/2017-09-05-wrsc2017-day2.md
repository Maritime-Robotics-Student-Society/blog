It sounds like a joke, but for a small boat in a big sea, staying in one place
is no simple matter. So for the second challenge, we had to stay as close as
possible to a particular GPS coordinate for 5 minutes.

The green circle above is a 20m radius around the location. You can see our
boat tacking against the wind to get there (the zig zag), staying close to it
(the tight ball of lines), and then being recovered afterwards (the smooth line
away from the marker). The official score was a radius of 6.5m, which we were
very pleased with. Last year we only managed about 25m.

We put the boat in for another run, but it didn't do what we wanted. Maybe it
felt that we were ungrateful for its excellent first performance.

All the teams taking part had made valid runs in the first two challenges.
Last year, many boats had failed to start the challenges because of the strong
current, so it was good to see a more satisfying contest.

The day wrapped up with dinner and a tour at the [Norwegian Coastal
Administration](http://www.kystverket.no/en) (Kystverket),
where (among other things) a handful of calm people in a control room monitor
the busy shipping traffic of the Oslofjord.

We want a control room like that for next year!
