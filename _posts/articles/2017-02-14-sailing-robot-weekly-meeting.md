Today's meeting started with a general discussion and continued with some work.

### Started a plan to open source `rosbag` data from last year.
We have more than a gigabyte of data from tests and the WSRC 2016 competition a we're working to make this data publicly available in a convenient way!

### First complete rewiring of all the electronics since WRSC 2016.
Got everything fully functioning and spotted some seawater corrosion on some connectors. Also did a bit of housekeeping on cables and updated some colours in the wiring diagrams.

### Researched improvements to the wind sensor

### Improve `rosbag` indexing to allow for easier management and visual inspection
