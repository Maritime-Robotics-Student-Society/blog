With the new year, it was about time to go through all the things we had collected over the year 2016. We found some last leftover water damaged electronics, for which we found appropriate safe recycling.
Then our materials were structured based on how often we use them: Every meeting, at every water test, or just occasionally as spare materials. Finally we put all our outreach materials into MacGyver, which will be our boat for traveling to such events.
For some large drawings of our first boat designs we opened a new section in our storage: History!

At the end of the day we were proud to see that we had reduced the chaos into some neatly sorted boxes:
