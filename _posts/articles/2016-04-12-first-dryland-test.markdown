Whilst planning for our upcoming second Dryland test (on the 30th of April), we just rediscovered some photos from our first dry land test at the start of March, right before the Science Day.

It was our very first attempt at assembling all the systems together. While assembling, weâ€™ve realised that we had clearly assigned team members working on all sensors and actuators, but no one was responsible for the power supply. However when getting our first set of components we did consider it, so our newly assigned Power Guy quickly had MacGyver running on batteries. Our electronics and firmware were not quite ready for sailing to a waypoint, so instead we set the sail and rudder position with a remote control. For our team members with less sailing experience this was a fun opportunity to learn a bit more by playing with MacGyver. They learned how human sailors detect the wind direction and the very weak and regularly changing wind directions on the day demonstrated some of the challenges our firmware will have to solve.

More experienced sailor always have wind awareness and can tell from which direction the wind blows on their face without thinking. A much funnier method is to lick your finger and hold it up to see from which side it gets cold.[/caption]



Our more experienced sailors happily helped out by notifying everyone else when one of our land manoeuvres would have capsized MacGyver. Whilst MacGyver looks more like a box than a boat, we decided to leave our test boat that way, since it is very useful for testing software whilst sitting at a desk.
