This year’s World Robotic Sailing Championship was special for us because we were both organisers and participants: twice the amount of work for the same amount of people. Trying to keep the organising team and the sailing robot one as separate as possible, we ended up just four people on the first competition day, two of them being at the WRSC for the first time. We also haven’t managed to test our boat, Black Python, for the past three months, so nobody was sure how this would go.

Calshot Spit did not provide us a warm welcome on Sunday, it was rather windy and rainy. However, on the next morning, first competition day, the wind fortunately calmed down enough to sail.

Plug in the battery, switch on the Raspberry Pi… Hurray! The sheets are moving and the rudder too. The wind wane works and the GPS is getting its position. Just calibration and the boat is ready for the race.

We are amongst the first teams to start the attempt. However, the initial excitement does not last long. Half way through the race, the Black Python, suddenly loses its course and nobody understands what’s happening. It wasn’t until the last competition day, when we discovered that the issue was caused by faulty USB cable that caused the Raspberry Pi to restart.

Luckily, the second attempt goes smoothly and we manage to finish the race on the first place. The GPS trace is shown below.
