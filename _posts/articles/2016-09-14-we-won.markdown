That's right. No kidding. We are officially the champions for 2016's World Robotic Sailing Championship (microsailboat class)! And at our very first try no less! It's been a week that's equal parts challenging, exciting, excruciating and rewarding. We've made our mistakes, but we've definitely learned a ton. We'll be coming back next year armed with way more knowledge than ever.

A big thank you to all our sponsors for making this opportunity a reality. And of course, to everyone else who cheered us on, wherever you may be. We couldn't have done it without all of your support!

So, until next year everyone!
