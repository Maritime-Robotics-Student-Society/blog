For sailing, a human is needed to plan the route, sense the direction of the wind and control the sail and the rudder accordingly. Â Our sailing robot team replaces human in three ways:




  * Muscles are replaced by servo motors


  * Senses are replaced by sensors


  * Brain is replaced by computers
