and all the supporters who chose to remain anonymous.













What a start to our weekend, and all thanks to you! To celebrate, we went to watch some other sailing boats: As a team social we went to watch the round the island race around the Isle of Wight - and started dreaming/planning how a larger sailing robot could participate in it.










Then on Sunday we had our next test day. So now we are finally taking the time to thank you all :) Elisavet has already drawn up a list of the rewards we have to prepare, so we will try to work our way through them in the next weeks - except for the post cards from the competition, those will have to wait until September ;)










We ourselves can’t wait to get some sailing robot stickers and post cards!
