![lake](https://sailrobot.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/lake.jpg) Isn't the undisturbed water of this lake in Southampton common a beautiful, calming view?

Well, a calm lake is not for us when we want to sail a boat! With little wind predicted for today, we hoped to find at least a tiny breeze, just enough to push a 1m boat around, but were unlucky.

On the positive side: We visited all our test locations, and the pictures below will show you what they look like in no-wind conditions. And our team members are so committed to the sailing robot, we decided on the spot, we will try again tomorrow! Slightly better wind conditions are promised around 5pm...
