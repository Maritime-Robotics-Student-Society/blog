The rules are not yet out, but there has been an interesting update to the competition website: Instead of up to 1 m, now boat up to 1.5 m are included in this class. Our work to date was based on building a 1 m boat, so this is a very important change for us!

Will we stick with our current, small and easy to carry hull? Or should we get a larger hull, with which we would be able to achieve larger speeds?

Looking over last yearâ€™s teams this also means that several of their boats will now be in the Micro sailboat class. It looks to become a much tighter competition. Overall an exciting change!
