Day four of the competition comes to the obstacle avoidance challenge. The Black Python first need to sail back and forth inside a 150 m by 20 m rectangular area, after that three orange ballon will be towed in the course as obstacle, the boat need to recognize and avoid those obstacle.  

Our strategy in obstacle avoidance is very simple: a set of way points are set along the direction inside the rectangular area. If no obstacle is found, the Black Python will sail straight ahead to the next way point. When the obstacle is detected by on board camera, our boat will try to sail towards an alternative way point perpendicular to the main course.

Preparation before the mission

The obstacle avoidance program reads image from Raspberry Pi continuously. It counts how many pixels in a image match the colour range of orange ballon -- the obstacle. If the percentage of obstacle pixels is large enough it then regard as an detection of obstacle.

Sounds good? But the unexpected peaceful weather on Thursday bring down the wind speed a lot and the changing wind direction make it very hard to finish the first part of challenge. It takes ages for the Black Python to even reach the start line. After the first trial, we change sail set from the smallest one to middle one but the wind completely die out as we are trying to getting through the start line. Beside, there is some compass issue that stop us from taking further trials today. But we did quite well to detect those obstacle on land and we are the only team only ever tried in this challenge.

The final day challenge is conclude with a celebration Champagne. All teams are invited to the prize given banquet dinner at Sjømilitære Samfund which was previous Maritime Society belongs to Norwegian Navy. During the dinner, we were given a short speech about the history about the Maritime Society. Competition organizer and sponsors kindly introduce the history of the city of Horten and story about how to the bring the competition the Norway. We really appreciate their effort the organizer have been put in the year's competition.

The most exciting part of the dinner comes to prize giving: with three out of four challenges completed in top position we successfully defended our title in the 'Micro Sailboat' class.


The trophy is a statue of traditional Viking longship

Southampton Sailing Robot Team would like to thank for everyone who support us in the competition. See you next year.


As we anticipated in our [recap of day one](/articles/wrsc2017-day1/), we didn't
have much time for writing blog posts during the competition. Now that we and
our boat are back in Southampton, it's time for a recap. You might want to get
a cup of tea to read this with.
