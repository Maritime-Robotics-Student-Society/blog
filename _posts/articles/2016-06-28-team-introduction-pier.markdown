Pier is a Ship Science student, and currently a summer intern in FSI, working on a Raspberry Pi ROV - his experience from our team will surely come in handy there! Usually though he is in charge of the boat construction, since he has a lot of hands on experience maintaining a (full scale) sailing boat. He designed our deck, making sure we have nothing on it that our sheets could get stuck on and we have a lot of space for batteries and electronics. Now he is in control of making said deck from carbon fibre, and assembling all the small parts that make our complete boat. So, with a HO HE HO HO, soon our Pi(e)rate ship will be finished and sailing the seven seas autonomously!

Help us meet our [funding](https://southampton.hubbub.net/p/sailrobot/) goals to make sure we and our boat can be in Portugal for WRSC2016!

Please have a look at our rewards, share our fundraiser and/or contribute to our campaign.

Funding that we don’t need this year will be used to build an even better boat next year.  All our work from this year is available, not only for next year’s team: Our boat and advice is available to any student working on a related project, e.g. for their individual project (IP), and our firmware is publicly available on [github](https://github.com/Maritime-Robotics-Student-Society/sailing-robot) to everyone.

Many thanks to everyone who already pledged support: Alistair Lynn, Matt Brown, Soon Sun Gan, Simone Provenzano, Kerrine Lee, Alessandro Romano, Lee Kwong Yong, andybs, Alex Ziang, drossrussell, Arnaud Wiertz, scki, Schneider - and all our sponsors who choose to remain anonymous. 
May you always find fair winds and following seas!
