Come to our stand at the Science and Engineering Day at the [University of Southampton](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/per/university/festival/science-and-engineering-day.page) tomorrow (Saturday, 12.3.16)!

You can learn more about the competition, see our progress, admire our new 1m hull and try to navigate your own course in a tacking simulator.

Kids (and grown up kids) can design their own sail, choose one of our foam hulls and race it downwind.

We will be in the new towing tank on Boldrewood campus. In the same building you can also find the wave powered vessel FLEUR, the Southampton Hydro Team and more ship science related activities and information.
