Today on the 3rd of July, we held another water test. The weather today was probably not the most ideal; though it was bright, there was a constant drizzle and less than stellar winds. Nevertheless, we trudge on. Under the shade of umbrellas we worked on tuning our PID code. Unfortunately however, the wind left a lot to be desired. Plus, the wind struggled to find a steady path in life and kept changing its direction, which caused our boat to have an unsteady heading demand, and it barely crept along its path.

Of course we didnâ€™t blame everything on the weather, as we made some errors as well on our end: Whilst we got a lot less unneeded tacking than we did last week, the heading demands from our heading control did not make sense at all times.

All in all it was a good(-ish) day of testing, and we made good progress, or at least we like to think we did.
