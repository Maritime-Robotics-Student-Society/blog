Hello once again! Here is a little update on how things are getting on over at SotonSailBoat HQ.

For the meeting today, we discussed on a way to more efficiently manoeuvre over waves; namely, if our boat needs to tack, it tacks when it's riding down a wave instead of when it's riding up it. Plan's still on the thinking phase however, so it'll be awhile before we have that implemented. In other news, we've ran calibration tests on our GPS module, and we're developing a new script to track GPS data too. Lastly, a trip to the estuary this Saturday may be happening, if the weather conditions allow. We might have our first water test this year real soon!

That's it for this week's update. Stay tuned for next week's!
