Tony is the leader of our hardware team. He is in charge of the lower lever electronics, coordinating who works on which system, designing the sensors and getting the servos working. He is especially looking forwards to adding more complex control to the sailing robot - once we have our basic systems working. Tony is a PhD student in Fluid Structure Interactions ([FSI](http://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/groups/fsi.page)) research group and he is also a member of [Southampton Hydro Team](http://southamptonhydroteam2016.weebly.com/). When Sophia cannot attend, he is responsible to start the meetings on Wednesdays.
