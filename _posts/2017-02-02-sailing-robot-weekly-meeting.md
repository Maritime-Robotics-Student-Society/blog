Today's meeting was spent on discussions on some pretty important events for the team.

# The Results of the Discussions
## Tuesdays Are Now The New Meeting Days
For this new semester, we'll be meeting on Tuesdays. However, legacy Thursday meetings will still be a thing. It's mostly for testing the waters now.

## Official First Saturday Meeting of This Semester Has Been Set
It's going to be on the 11th this month.

Last but not least,
## University Open Day Which Is on 18th March
The Open Day is once again here, and we'll be setting up a spot on campus, just as we did last year. We're definitely looking forward to enlightening ever more intrigued new minds to the fascinating world of robotic sailing.
