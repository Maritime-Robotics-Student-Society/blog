A former Intern at FSI, Sébastien although was only in Southampton for a short time, made and is still making an enormous contribution to the team. He is already back in France now! - But he is making sure he can still come to join us in Portugal. He has experience as a sailor and sailing model boats so he is contributing in a lot of places: Sebastian both understands race sailing and how to build an almost robotic boat. If he is not helping Pier with constructing the sailing boat, he is working on the wind sensors, researching wind vanes or debugging arduino code.


PS: It is also Sébastien who made our crowdfunding video and all the videos under our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTyD1mkkHjv4Pt5DJc9eMsQ)!
